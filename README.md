# GlobalSuperStore
A table which refelct the sales of different company between the period of 2012 and 2015. In this table I can see the product which was ordered on different dates, had shipped to the customer region in few days. Also we can see the amount of profit or loss has been earned for each order. The table throw us the data on sales regions, discounted amount on each order. 
So I have done an analysis of the global super store's product delivery table. In this project we have analysis few things related to sales in different region of the world respective of different years. Also have a profit-loss analysis and discounted amount on different products.
I have plotted dicounted amount and sales from orders. I get an observation like giving discount helps product to get order, but it's not helping that much. Giving more discount resulting less sales sometime. Most of the time zero amount of discount has more sales compared to more discounted products.
